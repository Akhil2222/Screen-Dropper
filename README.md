# Screen-Dropper
This is an app that will make you drop your screen.

### Installing the app
All you have to do for this app is install the files, and open up *home.html* to begin using this. You also have to allow pop-up screens

### How to use
In settings.html, you set the limitations for the app. You have to fill in each input for the certain limitations. When you are done, hide the tab, and make sure that the tab can't be closed. When the limit is exceeded, then the app will open up a HTML page that will make the screen blocked.

###### This is actually something I made for a school project, in which we have to have 4 screens. I've gone in and made the app functional, so I hope you enjoy.
